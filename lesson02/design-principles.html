            <p><strong>"The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices."</strong>
                In other words, less complexity puts less pressure on the user to make a choice, and
                they will make a choice in less time. Here, Google makes it easier to make a decision by reducing visual
                clutter and influences.

            <p><strong>"The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target."</strong>
                Making a touchable target or element on your mobile webpage also requires you to figure its size.
                If your button elements are too small, it frustrates the user and makes them take more time trying to tap
                what they want. On Microsoft's website, they made their nav buttons nice and large for ease of tapping them.

            <p>Different elements, depending on their characteristics, may stand out more than others. With this in mind,
                there can be an implied order or importance to elements of a webpage. Giving elements emphasis can help users know
                what they should look at to find information. There are other things to keep in mind, like keeping your colors similar
                for sake of unity, or using different colors to create a "pop". Other ideas like perspective, organization, and scale
                are also important. In this example
